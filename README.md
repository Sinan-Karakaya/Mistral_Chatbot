# Mistral Chatbot

This project is a chatbot UI using the Mistral API, and is submitted as a project for an internship/position at Mistral.
This project was realised in around 1h30~2h. With a strong background in creating UI that connects to LLM APIs professionnally,
I could re-use a lot of my existing knowledge and try to go beyond what I've done in the past.

The project is deployed and available [here](https://mistral-chatbot-zeta.vercel.app/).

## Features

This chatbot supports:

- Light/Dark mode
- Model selection
- Temperature selection
